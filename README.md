RenderSDK is a C++/Direct3D 12 project I am working in my spare time.
I started it around August last year when Direct12 API became publicly available with release of Windows 10.
My objective with the project was to gain practical experience with Direct3D 12 API.
I wanted to have a set of ready and easy to use utilities to implement and experiment with graphics effects, taking benefit of the new API features.
